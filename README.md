## Description
* KITE is a framework for semantic manipulation using keypoints as a mechanism for grounding language instructions in a visual scene, and a library of keypoint-conditioned skills for execution. This repo provides a lightweight implementation of simulated semantic grasping (grasping objects by specific object parts). 
* We leverage [ContactGraspNet](https://github.com/priyasundaresan/kite_semantic_grasping.git) as a grasping skill, and train a [CLIPort](google.com)-style model to map images and language (i.e. 'Pick up the screwdriver by the handle') to a visual keypoint. Finally, we filter grasps generated by the CGN grasp sampler to find one in close proximity to the deprojected predicted keypoint, and execute the grasp.
